ype Safety

Use explicit type definitions for all variables, parameters, and return values
Handle null/undefined values properly
Avoid implicit type conversions
Document expected inputs and outputs


Code Organization

Structure code by features/domains rather than technical layers
Follow single-responsibility principle for files and functions
Use descriptive, meaningful names that reveal intent
Write self-documenting code with minimal but effective comments


Modern UI & PWA Requirements

Create visually appealing, contemporary user interfaces
Ensure full responsiveness across all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
Implement Progressive Web App functionality:

Offline capabilities
App installability
Fast loading times
Service worker implementation


Design for both light and dark themes with proper contrast ratios
Use smooth transitions and animations that enhance UX without sacrificing performance


Quality & Maintainability

Prioritize readability and maintainability in all code
Consider performance optimization for critical paths
Write comprehensive tests covering both happy paths and edge cases
Implement proper error handling with helpful error messages
Extract reusable logic to prevent duplication
Validate all user inputs for security
Ensure accessibility compliance for all interactive elements
Use clear, descriptive commit messages



When generating code, always prioritize these principles while maintaining alignment with the project's specific technologies and patterns.
