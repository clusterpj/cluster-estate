# Calendar Implementation Context

## Current Implementation Status

### Database Schema
The following tables have been implemented in the database:

1. `calendar_sources`
   - Stores iCal feed URLs and their metadata
   - Contains fields: id, created_at, updated_at, property_id, name, url, last_synced_at, sync_frequency, is_active, sync_token, user_id
   - Has RLS policies for user-specific access
   - Indexed on property_id

2. `blocked_dates`
   - Stores synchronized calendar events
   - Contains fields: id, created_at, updated_at, property_id, source_id, start_date, end_date, external_id, summary, description
   - Has RLS policies for property-specific access
   - Indexed on property_id, source_id, and date range

### Frontend Components
A new `CalendarManagement` component has been created at `app/[locale]/admin/components/calendar-management.tsx` with the following features:

1. Calendar source management UI
   - Add new iCal feeds
   - Delete existing feeds
   - View sync status
2. Calendar visualization using the shadcn/ui Calendar component
3. Manual sync triggering
4. Property-specific calendar management
5. Error handling and loading states

## Required Next Steps

### 1. Backend Implementation
Need to create:
1. A serverless function for iCal feed synchronization that:
   - Fetches and parses iCal feeds
   - Updates the blocked_dates table
   - Handles incremental sync using sync_token
   - Manages conflict resolution
   - Updates last_synced_at timestamps

2. A cron job or scheduled task that:
   - Runs on the sync_frequency interval
   - Triggers the sync function for active calendar sources
   - Handles retry logic for failed syncs
   - Logs sync results for monitoring

### 2. Frontend Enhancements
Need to implement:
1. Calendar event details view
   - Show event information on click
   - Display conflicts and overlaps
   - Allow manual blocking of dates

2. Sync status monitoring
   - Show sync progress
   - Display sync history
   - Error reporting interface

3. Calendar export functionality
   - Generate iCal feeds for properties
   - Create public URLs for calendar sharing
   - Handle calendar subscription endpoints

### 3. API Endpoints
Need to create:
1. `/api/calendars/sync`
   - POST endpoint to trigger manual sync
   - Authentication required
   - Returns sync status

2. `/api/calendars/sources`
   - CRUD endpoints for calendar sources
   - Validation for iCal URLs
   - Property ownership verification

3. `/api/calendars/blocked-dates`
   - CRUD endpoints for blocked dates
   - Conflict checking
   - Availability calculation

4. `/api/calendars/export/:propertyId`
   - GET endpoint to generate iCal feed
   - Public access with token
   - Rate limiting

### 4. Integration Requirements
Need to integrate with:
1. Existing booking system
   - Prevent bookings on blocked dates
   - Update calendar when bookings are made
   - Handle booking cancellations

2. Property availability system
   - Update property status based on calendar
   - Handle multiple calendar sources
   - Manage overlapping blocks

3. Notification system
   - Alert on sync failures
   - Notify of booking conflicts
   - Send sync status updates

### 5. Testing Requirements
Need to implement:
1. Unit tests for:
   - iCal parsing functions
   - Date conflict resolution
   - Availability calculations

2. Integration tests for:
   - Calendar sync process
   - Booking integration
   - API endpoints

3. E2E tests for:
   - Calendar management UI
   - Sync functionality
   - Export features

## Technical Constraints
- Must use Supabase for database operations
- Must follow existing RLS policies
- Must use shadcn/ui components
- Must support internationalization
- Must handle timezone conversions
- Must be compatible with existing booking system

## Performance Requirements
- Calendar sync must complete within 30 seconds
- UI must remain responsive during sync
- Must handle large iCal feeds (1000+ events)
- Must support multiple concurrent syncs
- Must implement appropriate caching

## Security Requirements
- Validate iCal URLs before sync
- Sanitize imported calendar data
- Rate limit sync operations
- Implement proper access controls
- Handle sensitive booking data appropriately

This implementation is part of a property management system and needs to maintain compatibility with existing booking and property management features while adding robust calendar synchronization capabilities.

## Request for Assistance
When working with this system, please help with specific aspects of the implementation while keeping in mind the overall architecture and requirements. Specify which part of the system you're working on and any dependencies or constraints that need to be considered.
