# Calendar Implementation Context

## Current Implementation Status

### Database Schema
The following tables have been implemented in the database:

1. `calendar_sources`
   - Stores iCal feed URLs and their metadata
   - Contains fields: id, created_at, updated_at, property_id, name, url, last_synced_at, sync_frequency, is_active, sync_token, user_id
   - Has RLS policies for user-specific access
   - Indexed on property_id

2. `blocked_dates`
   - Stores synchronized calendar events
   - Contains fields: id, created_at, updated_at, property_id, source_id, start_date, end_date, external_id, summary, description, is_conflict, conflict_details
   - Has RLS policies for property-specific access
   - Indexed on property_id, source_id, and date range

### Frontend Components
The `CalendarManagement` component at `app/[locale]/admin/components/calendar-management.tsx` has been fully implemented with:

1. Calendar source management UI
   - Add new iCal feeds with validation
   - Delete existing feeds with confirmation
   - View sync status and history
2. Calendar visualization using shadcn/ui Calendar component
   - Color-coded conflict indicators
   - Date range selection
   - Event details on click
3. Sync functionality
   - Manual sync triggering
   - Sync status monitoring
   - Error reporting
4. Conflict resolution
   - Conflict detection and visualization
   - Resolution strategies (keep existing, use new, split difference)
   - Conflict history tracking
5. Property-specific calendar management
   - Property selection and filtering
   - Multi-calendar support
6. Error handling and loading states
   - Loading indicators
   - Error toasts
   - Retry mechanisms

### Backend Implementation
The following backend components have been implemented:

1. Serverless functions for:
   - iCal feed synchronization (`/api/cron/calendar-sync`)
   - Manual sync triggering (`/api/calendars/sync`)
   - Conflict resolution (`/api/calendars/conflicts/resolve`)
   - Calendar data querying (`/api/calendar/query`)

2. Cron job system:
   - Scheduled syncs every 5 minutes
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Sync status tracking
   - Error logging and monitoring

3. Sync features:
   - iCal feed parsing and validation
   - Timezone handling
   - Conflict detection and tracking
   - Incremental sync using sync_token
   - Batch processing for large feeds
   - Sync result logging

### API Endpoints
The following endpoints are implemented and tested:

1. `/api/calendars/sync`
   - POST endpoint for manual sync
   - Authentication required
   - Returns sync status and results

2. `/api/calendars/sources`
   - CRUD operations through Supabase client
   - iCal URL validation
   - Property ownership verification

3. `/api/calendars/blocked-dates`
   - CRUD operations through Supabase client
   - Conflict checking
   - Availability calculation

4. `/api/calendars/conflicts/resolve`
   - POST endpoint for conflict resolution
   - Supports multiple resolution strategies
   - Property ownership verification

5. `/api/calendar/query`
   - POST endpoint for querying calendar data
   - Returns blocked dates and calendar sources

## Required Next Steps

### 1. Frontend Enhancements
1. Calendar export functionality
   - Generate iCal feeds for properties
   - Create public URLs for calendar sharing
   - Handle calendar subscription endpoints

2. Enhanced conflict visualization
   - Visual indicators for different conflict types
   - Conflict resolution history view
   - Bulk conflict resolution

3. Sync history dashboard
   - Detailed sync performance metrics
   - Error rate tracking
   - Sync duration statistics

### 2. Backend Improvements
1. Rate limiting
   - Implement rate limiting for sync operations
   - Add queueing system for high-volume syncs

2. Enhanced error handling
   - Add error recovery mechanisms
   - Implement dead letter queue for failed syncs
   - Add detailed error logging

3. Performance optimization
   - Add caching for frequently accessed calendar data
   - Implement parallel processing for multiple sources
   - Add database indexing for common queries

### 3. Testing and Monitoring
1. Add unit tests for:
   - iCal parsing edge cases
   - Timezone handling
   - Conflict resolution logic

2. Add integration tests for:
   - Sync process with various iCal formats
   - Conflict detection scenarios
   - API endpoint validation

3. Add monitoring:
   - Sync success/failure rates
   - Conflict resolution statistics
   - Calendar source health monitoring

### 3. API Endpoints
Need to implement:
1. `/api/calendars/export/:propertyId`
   - GET endpoint to generate iCal feed
   - Public access with token
   - Rate limiting

2. `/api/calendars/status`
   - GET endpoint for sync status monitoring
   - Returns sync statistics and health status

3. `/api/calendars/history`
   - GET endpoint for sync history
   - Returns detailed sync logs and metrics

### 4. Integration Requirements
Need to integrate with:
1. Existing booking system
   - Prevent bookings on blocked dates
   - Update calendar when bookings are made
   - Handle booking cancellations

2. Property availability system
   - Update property status based on calendar
   - Handle multiple calendar sources
   - Manage overlapping blocks

3. Notification system
   - Alert on sync failures
   - Notify of booking conflicts
   - Send sync status updates

### 5. Testing Requirements
Need to implement:
1. Unit tests for:
   - iCal parsing functions
   - Date conflict resolution
   - Availability calculations

2. Integration tests for:
   - Calendar sync process
   - Booking integration
   - API endpoints

3. E2E tests for:
   - Calendar management UI
   - Sync functionality
   - Export features

## Technical Constraints
- Must use Supabase for database operations
- Must follow existing RLS policies
- Must use shadcn/ui components
- Must support internationalization
- Must handle timezone conversions
- Must be compatible with existing booking system

## Performance Requirements
- Calendar sync must complete within 30 seconds
- UI must remain responsive during sync
- Must handle large iCal feeds (1000+ events)
- Must support multiple concurrent syncs
- Must implement appropriate caching

## Security Requirements
- Validate iCal URLs before sync
- Sanitize imported calendar data
- Rate limit sync operations
- Implement proper access controls
- Handle sensitive booking data appropriately

This implementation is part of a property management system and needs to maintain compatibility with existing booking and property management features while adding robust calendar synchronization capabilities.

## Request for Assistance
When working with this system, please help with specific aspects of the implementation while keeping in mind the overall architecture and requirements. Specify which part of the system you're working on and any dependencies or constraints that need to be considered.
