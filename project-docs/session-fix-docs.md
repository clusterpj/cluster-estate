1. Created a Dedicated Logout Page
I created a new logout page at app/[locale]/auth/logout/page.tsx that:

Handles the logout process in a controlled environment
Shows a loading state while logging out
Provides error handling if logout fails
Includes a button to manually navigate to the home page
Uses proper translations for all text elements

2. Updated the Auth Provider
In components/providers/auth-provider.tsx, I modified the signOut function to:

Redirect to the logout page instead of directly to the home page
Preserve the current locale during redirection
Properly clean up the user session and state

3. Updated the Header Component
In components/header.tsx, I changed the logout buttons to:

Navigate to the logout page instead of directly calling the signOut function
Preserve the current locale during redirection
Maintain consistent behavior across both mobile and desktop views

4. Added Translation Keys
I added new translation keys in messages/en.json for the logout page:

loggingOut: "Logging Out"
loggingOutDescription: "You are being logged out of your account..."
logoutSuccess: "You have been successfully logged out"
logoutError: "There was an error logging you out"
pleaseWait: "Please wait while we log you out"
goToHome: "Go to Home Page"
goBack: "Go Back"
error: "Error"

5. Verified Middleware Configuration
I confirmed that the middleware was already correctly configured to:

Allow access to the logout page without authentication
Include /auth/logout in the authPaths array to prevent redirect loops

This approach improves the user experience by:

Providing visual feedback during the logout process
Ensuring a clean session termination
Maintaining proper navigation to public pages after logout
Preserving the user's selected language

If you need to update other components in the future, follow the same pattern of redirecting to the logout page instead of directly calling the signOut function.

# Authentication Rate Limit Handling

## Issue Overview

Supabase enforces rate limits on authentication-related API calls, including token refreshes. When these limits are exceeded, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` error with a message like:

```json
{
  "code": "over_request_rate_limit",
  "message": "Request rate limit reached"
}
```

This can happen in several scenarios:
- Multiple rapid page refreshes
- Concurrent API calls that trigger token refreshes
- Background processes that frequently check authentication status
- Network issues causing repeated retry attempts

## Impact

When rate limits are hit, users may experience:
- Inability to log in
- Being unexpectedly logged out
- Failed API requests
- Broken UI components that depend on authentication

## Implemented Solution

We've implemented a robust solution to handle rate limit errors gracefully:

### 1. Exponential Backoff for Retries

In the `refreshSession` function:
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
- Maximum of 3 retry attempts
- Base delay of 1 second, doubling with each retry
- Detailed logging of retry attempts

```typescript
// Example implementation
const executeRefresh = async (): Promise<any> => {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
    
    if (error && isRateLimitError(error)) {
      if (retryCount < maxRetries) {
        retryCount++;
        const delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, retryCount);
        console.log(`Rate limit hit. Retrying in ${delay}ms (attempt ${retryCount}/${maxRetries})`);
        
        return new Promise(resolve => {
          setTimeout(async () => {
            resolve(await executeRefresh());
          }, delay);
        });
      }
    }
    
    return { data, error };
  } catch (err) {
    return { data: { session: null }, error: err };
  }
};
```

### 2. Graceful Error Handling

- Specific detection of rate limit errors using message content and error codes
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback behaviors when rate limits are hit
- Consistent error logging

### 3. Defensive Sign Out Process

- Local state is cleared first before API calls
- Sign out continues to completion even if API calls fail
- Proper redirection to logout page regardless of API errors

### 4. Auth State Change Protection

- Try/catch blocks around auth state change handlers
- Specific handling for rate limit errors during auth state changes
- Fallback behaviors to maintain UI responsiveness

## Best Practices for Preventing Rate Limits

1. **Minimize Authentication Calls**
   - Avoid unnecessary session refreshes
   - Cache authentication state where appropriate
   - Use debouncing for functions that trigger auth checks

2. **Implement Progressive Loading**
   - Load non-authenticated content first
   - Defer authentication checks when possible

3. **User Education**
   - Advise users against rapid page refreshes when authentication issues occur
   - Provide clear guidance in error messages

4. **Monitoring**
   - Log rate limit occurrences
   - Track frequency and patterns
   - Consider implementing alerts for repeated rate limit hits

## Troubleshooting

If a user encounters persistent rate limit issues:

1. **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**
   - This removes any corrupted tokens

2. **Complete Sign Out**
   - Use the logout page to ensure proper session termination

3. **Wait Before Retrying**
   - Rate limits typically reset after a short period (minutes)

4. **Check Network Conditions**
   - Poor network connectivity can cause repeated failed requests

## Future Improvements

- Implement a toast notification system for user-visible error messages
- Add client-side token caching to reduce refresh frequency
- Consider implementing a service worker for offline authentication
- Add telemetry to track and analyze rate limit occurrences
