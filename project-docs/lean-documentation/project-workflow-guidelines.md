# Project Workflow Guidelines: Cabarete Villas

## Using the Progressive Detail Approach Effectively

1. **Start with High-Level Concepts**
   - Begin with the Phase Master Plan to understand the overall project structure
   - Review the Micro-PRD for the current phase to understand product vision and features
   - Consult the Mini-SRS for technical architecture and implementation approach

2. **Drill Down as Needed**
   - Use the Component Expansion Template to progressively add detail to components
   - Start with Level 1 (Conceptual Overview) and only expand to deeper levels as required
   - Focus on the minimum level of detail needed for the current development stage

3. **Just-in-Time Documentation**
   - Create detailed specifications only when implementation is imminent
   - Prioritize documenting areas with high complexity or team dependencies
   - Update documentation iteratively as understanding evolves

4. **Balance Documentation and Development**
   - Aim for "just enough" documentation to guide implementation without overspecifying
   - Document decisions and rationale, not just specifications
   - Use code as documentation where appropriate (with good comments and typing)

## Best Practices for Creating Task-Oriented Context Packets

1. **Tailor to the Task**
   - Include only information relevant to the specific task
   - Provide clear links to more detailed documentation when needed
   - Focus on what the implementer needs to know, not everything about the system

2. **Include Complete Context**
   - Ensure all dependencies and prerequisites are clearly identified
   - Include relevant code snippets and examples
   - Reference related components and interfaces

3. **Clarify Success Criteria**
   - Define clear acceptance criteria for the task
   - Include testing requirements and validation approaches
   - Specify any performance or quality expectations

4. **Anticipate Questions**
   - Address common questions or potential points of confusion
   - Include contact information for subject matter experts
   - Provide links to relevant external resources or documentation

## Process for Expanding High-Level Descriptions to Detailed Implementations

1. **Feature to Technical Module Mapping**
   - Start with feature descriptions from the Micro-PRD
   - Map features to technical modules in the Mini-SRS
   - Break down technical modules into specific components

2. **Component Expansion Process**
   - Use the Component Expansion Template to progressively add detail
   - Begin with conceptual overview (Level 1)
   - Expand functional specification (Level 2) when ready for design
   - Develop technical design (Level 3) before implementation
   - Add implementation details (Level 4) during development
   - Complete testing and maintenance sections (Levels 5-6) as appropriate

3. **Implementation Workflow**
   - Create a Task-Oriented Context Packet for each implementation task
   - Review and refine the packet with stakeholders before implementation
   - Update the Component Expansion documentation during implementation
   - Document decisions and changes in the Decision Log

4. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Revisit and update documentation as implementation progresses
   - Capture learnings and improvements for future components
   - Refactor documentation to reflect the actual implementation when complete

## Approach for Maintaining Cross-References Between Documents

1. **Consistent ID Convention**
   - Use the established ID convention for all references:
     - Features: F[Phase#].[Feature#] (e.g., F1.2)
     - Technical Modules: TM[Phase#].[Module#] (e.g., TM1.3)
     - Tasks: [Phase#].[Milestone#].[Task#] (e.g., 1.2.3)
     - Decisions: D[Sequential#] (e.g., D5)
     - Components: C[Phase#].[Module#].[Component#] (e.g., C2.1.1)

2. **Explicit References**
   - Always use full IDs when referencing other documents
   - Include brief context when referencing (e.g., "as specified in F2.1-AdvancedSearch")
   - Use hyperlinks in digital documentation when possible

3. **Dependency Tracking**
   - Clearly document dependencies between features, modules, and tasks
   - Update dependent documentation when changes are made
   - Use the Progress Tracker to monitor the status of dependent items

4. **Documentation Map**
   - Maintain a central index of all documentation
   - Regularly audit cross-references for consistency and accuracy
   - Update references when documentation structure changes

## Strategy for Incorporating AI Feedback into Documentation

1. **AI-Assisted Documentation Review**
   - Use AI to identify gaps, inconsistencies, or ambiguities in documentation
   - Request AI feedback on documentation clarity and completeness
   - Apply AI suggestions to improve documentation quality

2. **AI-Generated Documentation Drafts**
   - Use AI to generate initial drafts of documentation based on requirements
   - Review and refine AI-generated content for accuracy and completeness
   - Incorporate human expertise and context where AI lacks domain knowledge

3. **Documentation Enhancement with AI**
   - Use AI to suggest improvements to existing documentation
   - Apply AI to standardize terminology and formatting
   - Leverage AI for translating documentation for international teams

4. **Continuous Learning Loop**
   - Feed implementation outcomes back to AI to improve future recommendations
   - Use AI to analyze patterns in successful documentation approaches
   - Continuously refine AI prompts based on the quality of generated content

## Documentation Maintenance Best Practices

1. **Regular Review Cycles**
   - Schedule periodic reviews of all documentation
   - Prioritize updating documentation for active development areas
   - Archive or clearly mark outdated documentation

2. **Version Control**
   - Store documentation in version control alongside code
   - Use meaningful commit messages for documentation changes
   - Consider using tags or releases to mark documentation versions

3. **Ownership and Accountability**
   - Assign clear ownership for each documentation area
   - Include documentation updates in definition of done for tasks
   - Review documentation changes as part of the code review process

4. **Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Establish channels for feedback on documentation
   - Regularly solicit input from documentation users
   - Track common questions as indicators of documentation gaps
