# Decision Log: Cabarete Villas

## Decision: D1 - Next.js App Router Architecture
- **Date**: Initial project setup
- **Context**: Need for a modern, performant frontend architecture with support for both client and server components
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Next.js Pages Router
  - Pure React SPA with separate backend
  - Other frameworks (Remix, Nuxt, etc.)
- **Decision**: Implement Next.js App Router architecture with a hybrid approach of Server and Client Components
- **Rationale**: App Router provides superior performance through React Server Components, streaming, and partial rendering. The architecture also simplifies API integration with route handlers and maintains full-stack TypeScript support.
- **Impacts**:
  - PRD Features: All features benefit from improved performance and SEO
  - SRS Modules: All technical modules are structured around App Router conventions

## Decision: D2 - Supabase for Database and Auth
- **Date**: Initial project setup
- **Context**: Need for a database with authentication, storage, and real-time capabilities
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Firebase
  - MongoDB + custom auth
  - PostgreSQL + Auth0
- **Decision**: Use Supabase for database, authentication, and storage
- **Rationale**: Supabase provides PostgreSQL with powerful features like Row-Level Security, real-time subscriptions, and integrated auth. The platform offers a familiar SQL interface with strong TypeScript support and serverless functions for backend logic.
- **Impacts**:
  - PRD Features: F1.1-Authentication, F1.2-PropertyManagement, F1.3-BookingSystem
  - SRS Modules: All data-related modules

## Decision: D3 - PayPal Integration for Payments
- **Date**: Phase 1, Milestone 1.4
- **Context**: Need for a secure, reliable payment processor for property bookings
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Stripe
  - Braintree
  - Multiple payment processors

- **Impacts**:
  - PRD Features: F1.4-PaymentIntegration
  - SRS Modules: TM1.5-PaymentProcessor

## Decision: D4 - React Query for Data Management
- **Date**: Phase 1, Milestone 1.2
- **Context**: Need for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - SWR
  - Redux + custom fetch logic
  - Context API + fetch
- **Decision**: Implement React Query (TanStack Query) for data fetching and state management
- **Rationale**: React Query provides automatic caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates. The library reduces boilerplate, handles loading/error states gracefully, and integrates well with TypeScript for type safety.
- **Impacts**:
  - PRD Features: All features with data requirements
  - SRS Modules: All client-side data modules

## Decision: D5 - Shadcn/UI Component System
- **Date**: Phase 1, UI Framework Selection
- **Context**: Need for a consistent, accessible, and customizable UI component system
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Material UI
  - Chakra UI
  - Custom component library
- **Decision**: Implement shadcn/ui based on Radix UI primitives with TailwindCSS
- **Rationale**: Shadcn/UI provides accessible, unstyled components that can be fully customized. The system offers excellent TypeScript support, follows a copy-paste approach that reduces bundle size, and integrates seamlessly with TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Impacts**:
  - PRD Features: All user-facing features
  - SRS Modules: All UI-related modules

## Decision: D6 - Next-intl for Internationalization
- **Date**: Phase 2, Milestone 2.3
- **Context**: Need for comprehensive internationalization support
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - i18next
  - Lingui
  - Custom translation system
- **Decision**: Implement next-intl for internationalization with locale-based routing
- **Rationale**: Next-intl provides seamless integration with Next.js App Router, supports both client and server components, and offers excellent TypeScript support. The library handles complex message formatting, pluralization, and date/number formatting.
- **Impacts**:
  - PRD Features: F2.3-Internationalization
  - SRS Modules: TM2.3-I18nFramework

## Decision: D7 - React Big Calendar for Calendar UI
- **Date**: Phase 2, Milestone 2.2
- **Context**: Need for a comprehensive calendar interface for availability management
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Full Calendar
  - Custom calendar implementation
  - Simple date picker
- **Decision**: Implement React Big Calendar for calendar visualization
- **Rationale**: React Big Calendar provides a full-featured calendar component with multiple views (day, week, month), event rendering, and drag-and-drop functionality. The library is well-maintained, customizable, and integrates well with React.
- **Impacts**:

  - SRS Modules: TM2.2-CalendarSystem

## Decision: D8 - Recharts for Data Visualization
- **Date**: Phase 2, Milestone 2.4
- **Context**: Need for interactive and responsive data visualizations for analytics
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - D3.js
  - Chart.js
  - Victory
- **Decision**: Implement Recharts for data visualization
- **Rationale**: Recharts provides a React-native charting library built on D3.js with a declarative API. The library offers responsive charts, smooth animations, and customizable components with strong TypeScript support.
- **Impacts**:
  - PRD Features: F2.4-AnalyticsReporting
